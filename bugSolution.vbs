Explicit Type Declaration and Early Binding: To avoid type-related issues, explicitly declare variable types and use early binding whenever possible. Early binding allows the compiler to check data types during compilation, catching many potential problems before runtime. 
```vbscript
Dim x As Integer
x = 10 + 5
MsgBox x 'Displays 15
```
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling using `On Error Resume Next` and `Err` object to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent the script from crashing. 
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim x
x = "abc" + 5
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    MsgBox "Error: " & Err.Description
    Err.Clear
End If
```
Input Validation:  Always validate any data coming from external sources, such as user input or data from files, to make sure it's in the expected format and type before using it in your script.
